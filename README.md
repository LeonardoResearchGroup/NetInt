# NetInt #

NetInt is a Java-based node-link visualization tool initially developed to analyze financial communities of hundreds of thousands of bank clients clustered by their transactions. The latest open-source release is designed to visualize all kinds of directed graphs.

It supports the visual discovery of patterns across the entire dataset, affording a hierarchical view of the network that could be filtered, zoomed in or drilled down. The underlying principle of Netint is the display of recursively aggregated elements with common attribute values, either categorical or numerical (integers). The graph processing core is [JUNG](http://jung.sourceforge.net/), a Java graph library that handles all the operations on nodes or edges. The interactive environment for visualization and user direct manipulation is based on the core library of [Processing](http://processing.org) and OpenGL. Moreover, our system allows for the connection of R scripts and packages such as IGraph \cite{CSardi:2006:Igraph} to do statistical processing not offered by JUNG.
